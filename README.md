# Lemon üçã

Experimental Scheme implementation ([R7RS-small](https://small.r7rs.org/)) that compiles to [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), as opposed to the more common C target. 

The goals of this project are to create a simple reference implementation, conform to the specification, and to experiment with a newer compile target. Although not a primary goal, it might also be interesting to have an extension language for Zig, similar to [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) being an extension language for C and C++.

You can learn more about the merits of Zig in the [in-depth overview](https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/) and the [Why Zig?](https://ziglang.org/learn/why_zig_rust_d_cpp/) page.

- [Lisp In Small Pieces](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/lisp-in-small-pieces/66FD2BE3EDDDC68CA87D652C82CF849E) is a comprehensive textbook on compiling lisps.
- [Gambit Scheme](https://github.com/gambit/gambit), an efficient Scheme that compiles to C.
- [Cheney on the MTA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/214448.214454), paper that describes an interesting compilation technique and garbage collection mechanism.
- [Chicken Scheme](https://call-cc.org/) implements the above paper, more on it's [garbage collection internals here](https://www.more-magic.net/posts/internals-gc.html) and [the overall compilation here](https://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-compilation-process).
- [Lambda Papers](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lambda_Papers) are considered a classic for any budding Scheme enthusiast.

## Development

**Lemon** is itself implemented in Zig. There are no dependencies beyond Zig itself. See the official [getting started](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#installing-zig) page for installation instructions.
